A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## This is the Cross course project that was made at Noroff Academy of Technology and Media.
We got to choose between categories and this was it for me. This has been a continuous project that was updated several times. 
Its the first project we started when learning CSS ans HTML - then added with vanilla JS. 

In more depth: 
  The concept is a page that was meant for gamers, to buy, sell and trade their games from eachother as well as give the option to buy completely new ones. 
  There responsiveness of the page was done with a rough sketch - but i am pleased with it.
